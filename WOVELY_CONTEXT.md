# WOVELY MASTER DOC v93

## CURRENT PRODUCTION STATE
Live on wovely.app — Session 52 shipped. DKIM authentication live and verified. Gmail inbox delivery confirmed with DKIM PASS in headers. Supabase upgraded to Pro tier with spend cap enabled. WEBHOOK_SECRET still pending.

## FIRST THING NEXT SESSION
1. Set WEBHOOK_SECRET in Vercel + verify Stripe signatures in webhook handler — FINANCIAL INTEGRITY GAP
2. CORS audit on all serverless functions
3. RLS full table audit
4. Background functions + queue system build (see spec below)

## SESSION 53 PRIORITY ORDER
1. WEBHOOK_SECRET + Stripe signature verification (security — financial integrity)
2. CORS audit — all serverless functions
3. RLS full table audit
4. Background functions + import queue system (with RLS on import_jobs from day one)
5. Collections build — naturally extends queue system
6. BevCheck UI polish — needs Danielle written feedback first
7. notify-signup.js wiring
8. Yearly pricing ($9.99)
9. Pattern Share / Trophy Case

## SECURITY AUDIT (from Reddit AI codebase review — Session 50)
Source: Solo founder built SaaS in 6 months with AI. Code review revealed systemic invisible-layer gaps.
Core lesson: AI is consistently good at visible (UI, features, flows) and consistently weak at invisible (security, testing, architecture, vendor lock-in).

Wovely findings mapped:

[SOLID] Vendor lock-in — Provider router with Gemini + Haiku fallback. We own both keys. Not locked in.
[SOLID] Auth — Supabase handles all auth + crypto. No Math.random() password generation.
[ACTION REQUIRED] WEBHOOK_SECRET — Env var exists in pending actions but not yet set. Without it, Stripe signatures are unverified. Anyone who knows the webhook URL can fake subscription events. Fix FIRST.
[ACTION REQUIRED] CORS — Wildcard Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * likely present on all serverless functions. Audit and restrict to wovely.app origin.
[ACTION REQUIRED] RLS audit — Verify all existing tables have correct policies. New tables (import_jobs, collections) must have RLS from day one — never retroactively.
[ACTION REQUIRED] Stripe webhook verification — Confirm checkout.session.completed handler verifies stripe-signature header before processing.
[ACKNOWLEDGED] Zero automated tests — Defensible at 9 users. Becomes liability at scale. Payment flows and auth paths need coverage before public launch.

## WHAT SHIPPED SESSION 49
- Gemini billing confirmed active — Paid Tier 1, StitchBox project, $28.77 spent Mar 19-Apr 15
- Spend cap set at $50/mo
- Gemini 2.5 Flash restored across all API files (was 1.5 Flash since Session 47)
- Files updated: _providerRouter.js, extract-pattern.js, fetch-pattern.js, stitch-vision.js
- All /v1beta/ paths preserved
- Rollback tag pre-gemini-25 created on main
- Tested: Marina the Manatee (text path, Haiku), Beehive (vision path, Gemini 2.5 Flash), Stitch-O-Vision Waffle Stitch — all passed
- Octopus 87-page timeout is a known client-side issue, server completes but client gives up — separate bug

## WHAT SHIPPED SESSION 52
- DKIM authentication configured end-to-end for wovely.app
- Google Workspace DKIM record generated (2048-bit, selector: google)
- TXT record published via GoDaddy DNS

## KEY LEARNINGS SESSION 49
- Gemini 2.5 Flash 503s were free tier problem, not model problem — paid tier held up clean
- Vision path (avgText/page <1200) uses Gemini. Text path (>1200) uses Haiku chunking. These are separate pipelines.
- Client timeout fires before server finishes on large chunked jobs — client needs better waiting UX
- Supabase API calls are unlimited on all plans — upgrading Supabase is about uptime/reliability not rate limits
- Vercel Pro already active — background functions available, just need to be built

## BACKGROUND FUNCTIONS + QUEUE SYSTEM SPEC (build Session 50+)
Problem: Large PDFs (87+ pages, text path) take 150s+ of Haiku chunking. Client times out. User sees failure even when server succeeds.
Solution: Async import queue with background processing and real-time UI feedback.

Architecture:
- Supabase table: import_jobs (id, user_id, status, pdf_url, result, created_at, updated_at)
- RLS REQUIRED FROM DAY ONE: user can only read/write their own rows (auth.uid() = user_id)
- Client submits job -> gets job_id back immediately
- Vercel background function processes job async, updates import_jobs row on completion
- Client polls import_jobs every 3s for status updates
- UI shows Bev loading state with progress messaging while job runs
- On completion, flows into normal pattern review UI

UI vision:
- Queue dashboard showing active/pending/completed imports
- Bev animated waiting state with fun copy (not just a spinner)
- Progress indicator showing which chunk is being processed
- Naturally extends into Collections — queue multiple patterns, process as a batch

This is the foundation Collections needs anyway. Build queue first, Collections becomes a UI wrapper on top.

## OPEN BUGS (priority order)
1. Client timeout fires on large PDFs before server finishes — needs better waiting UX + queue system
2. BevCheck UI — gauge typography, zone labels, full report unfinished. Needs Danielle feedback first
3. Modal layering bug — desktop import modal stacked background layers
4. Stitch-O-Vision complex geometric prompts
5. StitchResultPage favicon missing
6. Bev Notes nav icon — blue shield needs personality
7. PDF cover intelligence — text-heavy first pages as hero
8. /hive fossil route — YarnHive remnant
9. Pages not scrolling to top on load

## GEMINI STATUS
Gemini 2.5 Flash: ACTIVE. Restored Session 49. Model string: gemini-2.5-flash. API path: /v1beta/
Gemini 1.5 Flash: RETIRED. Was stable fallback, now replaced.
Rollback: git checkout pre-gemini-25 if 2.5 Flash shows instability on production.

## ANTHROPIC API STATUS
Tier 1 — 90K OTPM, 1K RPM. $40 credit added Apr 14 2026.
Haiku: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
max_tokens BevCheck: 2000. max_tokens extract: 32000

## EXTRACT PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE (as of Session 49)
Client detects avgText/page:
- <300 or 300-1200 (mixed) = vision path = POST /api/extract-pattern-vision with pdfUrl — GEMINI 2.5 FLASH
- >1200 = text path = POST /api/extract-pattern with full pdfText, 270s client timeout — HAIKU CHUNKED

Server extract-pattern.js:
- <14k chars = single pass: Gemini fast-path (4s) then Haiku fallback (55s)
- >14k chars = chunked: splitIntoChunks(14k, 500 overlap) then sequential callClaudeChunk then mergeChunkResults
- 250s budget guard stops chunking early
- maxDuration: 300

BevCheck cascade: Gemini 2.5 Flash v1beta (8s) then Haiku 55s (2000 max_tokens) then bev_tangled

## COLLECTIONS SPEC (ready to build Session 50+)
Naturally extends import queue system. Build queue first, Collections is the UI wrapper.
Schema ready to write. 4 Claude Code prompts needed. 2 sessions to ship v1.
v1: collections table + collection_patterns join + UI list + detail page + import wiring.
MCAL import already works as components. Collections is the grouping wrapper.
Monetization: gate behind Craft tier (~$14.99/mo).
RLS REQUIRED FROM DAY ONE on collections and collection_patterns tables.

## TECHNICAL GOTCHAS
supabaseAuth.getUser() is SYNCHRONOUS — never await
Pattern fetch needs Range: 0-499 header
DEFAULT_STARTERS excluded from stats
detailOnSave must spread updated_at onto local state
Hero image: PILL sentinel check before using photo field
Vercel Pro: maxDuration 300 on extract-pattern.js and extract-pattern-vision.js
iOS: background-attachment fixed broken — use fixed pseudo-elements
Gemini: strip markdown fences before JSON.parse
Gemini responses: skip parts where part.thought === true
Gemini 2.5 Flash: ACTIVE — model string gemini-2.5-flash, API path /v1beta/
Claude Haiku model: MUST use claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
BevCheck max_tokens: 2000
Missing await on async = silent 500. Check this first.
Mobile background fetch: start fetch before UI transition
user_profiles has NO email column — join through auth.users
PDFs -> Supabase Storage. Images -> Cloudinary. Brand assets -> /public
SessionStorage: wovely_feedback_draft, wovely_redirect_intent
useBlocker requires createBrowserRouter — Wovely uses BrowserRouter, do NOT use
iPad Safari scroll bounce: never overflow-y scroll on inner containers
BevCheck calls never go direct to Gemini from browser
Provider router: probes gemini-2.5-flash on /v1beta/ — must match actual call model and path
Large PDF chunking: SHIPPED S48
Smart PDF routing: SHIPPED S48 — avgText/page threshold 300/1200
Fixed position banners in Dashboard.jsx: DO NOT USE — causes layout issues
App.jsx fragment wrapping: DO NOT wrap App return in React fragments — breaks render
Client timeout fires before server finishes on large jobs — queue system needed
RLS must be applied to ALL new tables at creation time — never retroactively
CORS: audit all serverless functions — wildcard origin likely present, restrict to wovely.app
Stripe webhook: must verify stripe-signature header before processing any event

## STITCH-O-VISION
Gemini 2.5 Flash — no Haiku fallback. Complex geometric patterns: ongoing prompt refinement needed.

## CHANGELOG RULE
Only user-facing features. Never mention AI — Bev language only. Prepend each session.

## CLAUDE CODE DESKTOP APP WORKFLOW
Adopted Session 50. Desktop app replaces CLI terminal + browser alt-tab workflow.

Two-window setup:
- Claude.ai in browser = strategy conversations with Claude (this instance). Master doc context lives here.
- Claude Code desktop app = code execution. Opus 4.7 xhigh default.
- Alt-tab between them. Do NOT try to unify in one window.

Panel usage:
- Chat panel = where Claude Code executes tasks. Paste Claude.ai prompts here. 95% of work happens here.
- Terminal panel = for manual commands Adam runs himself (git status, git push, npm run dev). Skip Claude turn when command is known.
- Preview panel = for UI work. Runs local dev server inside desktop. Essential for landing page, BevCheck UI, queue dashboard, anything Danielle-facing.
- Diff viewer = mandatory before every merge. Replaces git diff in terminal. Catches mistakes before shipping.
- Plan panel = for big tasks. Turn on for queue system build, Collections. Skip for small fixes.
- Tasks panel = for multi-step work tracking. Queue system build is ideal use case.

Session management:
- New session per feature branch. Do not reuse old sessions for new tasks.
- Each session gets isolated git worktree. Changes in one session do not affect others until committed.
- Parallel sessions for independent tasks (CORS audit + queue build can run simultaneously).

Permission modes:
- Ask permissions (default) = approve every edit. Use for Stripe, auth, production hotfixes.
- Auto mode = Claude handles permissions via classifiers. Use for queue system build, CORS fixes, RLS additions, Collections build.
- Plan mode = Claude maps approach without touching files. Use before large refactors.

Model:
- Opus 4.7 xhigh default. Current Adam setting: High. Bump to xhigh for queue system and Collections.

Routines (later, not now):
- After Collections ships: weekly security audit, nightly pattern import health, PostHog digest, changelog generator.

Ultrareview budget:
- 3 free remaining. Spend on: post-queue-system pre-merge, post-Stripe-verification pre-merge, first Craft tier feature.

Master doc status:
- External API workflow still in use as of Session 50.
- Evaluating Project knowledge migration in Session 51 as parallel test.
- Do not deprecate until replacement is proven across at least one session.

## CLAUDE RULES
Fetch master doc first, no exceptions
Next session = 53
Danielle feedback overrides everything
ONE complete Claude Code prompt per task
Never push direct to main
Match Adam energy
ALWAYS query vercel_logs first when debugging
Model swap first when provider is flaky
Proactively flag platform limits and upgrade paths
Never use em dashes in copy or emails written for Adam
